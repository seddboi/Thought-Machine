# Introduction
Welcome to Thought Machine!
This is a basic React-based application that utilizes all core features of React to seek out one main goal: to have a open space to share youyr thoughts without those thoughts being stuck on the internet forever! Every thought shared here disappears after 15 seconds, so feel free to share whatever you would like! 

# Development

Thought Machine utilizes the basic stepping stones for a React project:
1. Primarily, it utilizes various components which make up the UI/UX of the whole project
2. The project also uses the useState React function, to store user entered data, specifically speaking the data entered on the form line on the page.
3. The useEffect React function is utilized to trigger deletion of the thoughts after a specific amount of time; there is also a provided ability to manually delete the thoughts shared by clicking the "x" next to the thought itself.
4. The time remaining was created by utilizing the Date.now() built in Javascript function, and setting the time 15 seconds from the current time received.
